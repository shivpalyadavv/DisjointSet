# Disjoint Set Data Structures
A data structure that stores non overlapping or disjoint subset of elements is called disjoint set data structure. The disjoint set data structure supports following operations:

Adding new sets to the disjoint set.
Merging disjoint sets to a single disjoint set using Union operation.
Finding representative of a disjoint set using Find operation.
Check if two sets are disjoint or not.
